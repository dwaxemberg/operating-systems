Pipes have a few disadvantages in sorting. First of all, they cause the child processes to not be able to write to
standard out or read from standard in. This means the child process cannot interact with the user during runtime. Another
disadvantage of pipes is that they are unidirectional so multiple pipes are required for transferring data. Using pipes also
requires many processes to be spawned and thus there is a large overhead and limited length of input data. A traditional merge
sort requires very little overhead and scales much slower than this pipe method with increased input length.
